2. Maven Installations: Download Maven from https://maven.apache.org/install.html and configure in the system
    please run `mvn --version` from command line to see mvn
3. Selenium WebDriver (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
4. Cucumber JVM (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
5. geckodriver file to run the tests on firefox browser (download from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
    Its already attached here in this project, so no need of downloading it)
    NOTE: If you running the tests in `Windows` Please change the path for the profile as shown below

           public void startBrowser() {
               System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "src/test/resources/geckodriver.exe");
               driver = new ChromeDriver();
               driver.get(baseURL);
               driver.manage().window().maximize();
               driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
           }```
           
6. Run The Tests from command line:
   Unzip the project folder
   Open command line bash, go to the project folder where you got pom.xml file and run the below command
   Run all the scenarios using below command
   `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@smoke"`
    or you can run `RunTests.java` which triggers the tests

7. Using IDE:
   we can use IntellijIdea or eclipse 
   Download Intellij Idea Community Edition (for FREE) from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   Make Sure you got below Plugins installed on Intellij Idea:

8. Run the project Using IDE 
    Make sure JAVA is configured to Intellij Idea and other plugins (Cucumber, Maven)
    Unzip the Project and Open the project folder in IntelliJ Idea IDE
    You can change the tags accordingly in `RunTests.java` file and Run `RunTests.java` class
